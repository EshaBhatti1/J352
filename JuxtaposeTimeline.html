<p>For the Knight Labs Timeline assignment, I decided to create a timeline featuring the various gigs held by Julie Andrews throughout her lifetime who is primarily known for her film-acting. She is arguable my family's favorite actress for the humor she brings to her characters and catchy songs she brings to her musicals. For the Knight Labs Juxtapose assignment, I decided to create a before and after slider of how the Eiffel Tower looks at night versus in the day time. </p>
